# shopping-cart-mini-game
This is a mini shopping cart game I built to practice and apply concepts I learned using the Tkinter module in Python.
Players can interact with a simple GUI to add or remove items from a shopping cart, while learning the basics of event handling, buttons, and GUI design.

Features

🖱️ Clickable buttons to add/remove items
🛍️ Real-time cart updates
🎨 GUI built entirely with Tkinte
